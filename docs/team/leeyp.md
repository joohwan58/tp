## Overview
This is a student project for university software development course.

I am one of the contributors to the FridgeFriend project.

## Project: FridgeFriend

FridgeFriend is an app for managing food in the fridge, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).
If you can type fast, FridgeFriend can track your cold or frozen groceries faster and easier than any other apps.
It is written in Java.
